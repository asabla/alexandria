## Planning Workflow

This directory contains the active implementation plan for the project. The planning structure follows three levels of detail:

### Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `metadata.yaml` | Plan metadata (name, dates, status) |
| `00_overview.md` | Bird's eye view - goals, phases, key decisions |
| `01_stories.md` | User stories organized by phase and epic |
| `02_tasks.md` | Detailed tasks with hierarchical IDs |

### Workflow

1. **Start here**: Review `00_overview.md` for the big picture
2. **Understand scope**: Check `01_stories.md` for what we're building
3. **Get to work**: Use `02_tasks.md` to track progress on specific tasks

### Task ID Format

Tasks use hierarchical IDs: `P{phase}-E{epic}-S{story}-T{task}`

Example: `P0-E1-S2-T3` = Phase 0, Epic 1, Story 2, Task 3

### When Complete

Archive this plan using:
```bash
./scripts/plan/archive-plan.sh
```

This moves the plan to `docs/plans/` for historical reference.
